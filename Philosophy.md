#Mission

ELMS Learning Network empowers faculty, instructional designers and technologists to produce customized learning ecosystems for learners.

#Audience

ELMSLN is designed to work for any educational or training use-case. Out of the box it is for small groups but built on a framework with the flexibility and automation required to run in clustered, large scale cloud deployments (if needed). A learning network designed to power 1 course for 1 person is just as important as one with hundreds of courses for 10s of thousands of peopke.

#We value pedagogy over technology.

The product has been engineered under the hood to be extensible, moving developers and code development to the background so that pedogogy, usability and workflow customization can be the focus of those that demand it. If options must be presented in the user interface they should be minimal, but APIs beneath the surface can expose more options to developers. While built the Drupal framework, we never seek to emphasize that fact as usability should be king, not platform.

#Everyone wants to put their stamp on course experiences for learners

Which is part of why we treat every course like a special snowflake, using an architecture that allows for that level of flexibility when needed. Usable but maliable is key.
