#Vendors

##Hosting Providers
We need to create a policy about vendor relationships when it comes to hosting. When we will engage in producing one-line installers that need maintained and when we will work with community members to help get future hosting providers supported. Also the arrangement that our community has with theirs needs to be established.

##Service oriented providers
It is not that vendors are not important to this community, it is ensuring that the relationship is one that is mutually beneficial and ensures all efforts are contrbuted back as much as possible. As a result, this needs hashed out as to when and how we will provide a space for the contracted support community.
