# ethos
The ethos of ELMSLN community is where we all decide the direction we wish to take society that participates in our platform. This is not a repo for technical conversations, it is one of philosophy and principles which should steer the future of the platform and the community.

Our Ethos lives here so that it may be forked, cloned and committed to especially as it pertains to Mission, Philosophy and engagement with Service oriented vendors.
